Welcome to my Data Science Learning Roadmap repository!
This repo is a structured week-by-week guide to help you learn and practice key concepts in Data Science, starting from the basics and progressing toward advanced topics.
Each week focuses on a specific area â€” like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and more â€” with hands-on Jupyter Notebooks to help you learn by doing.
Currently, I've uploaded content up to Week 4, and I'll keep adding new notebooks every week.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
This roadmap is designed to give you a clear, practical path to start your Data Science journey.
If you're passionate about learning Data Science, use this as an outline â€” explore deeper topics, experiment with datasets, and keep building projects as you go.

## âš¡ Contribution
This is a learning roadmap, but if you have ideas, improvements, or suggestions â€” feel free to open an issue or pull request. Let's grow together as data enthusiasts!

## ðŸ§  Final Note
This repository is not a finished product â€” it's a living roadmap that grows every week.
If you're truly passionate about Data Science, take this as a starting point and research deeper into each concept.
Keep learning, stay curious, and push your limits. ðŸš€
