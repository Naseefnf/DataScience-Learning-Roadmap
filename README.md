ðŸ§  Data Science Learning Roadmap

Welcome to my Data Science Learning Roadmap repository!
This repo is a structured week-by-week guide to help you learn and practice key concepts in Data Science, starting from the basics and progressing toward advanced topics.

Each week focuses on a specific area â€” like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and more â€” with hands-on Jupyter Notebooks to help you learn by doing.
Currently, Iâ€™ve uploaded content up to Week 4, and Iâ€™ll keep adding new notebooks every week.


ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This roadmap is designed to give you a clear, practical path to start your Data Science journey.
If youâ€™re passionate about learning Data Science, use this as an outline â€” explore deeper topics, experiment with datasets, and keep building projects as you go.


ðŸ§­ How to Use

1. Clone the repository
    git clone https://github.com/Naseefnf/DataScience-Learning-Roadmap.git
2. Open any .ipynb file using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Follow along with the exercises and experiment with your own data.

âš¡ Contribution

This is a personal learning roadmap, but if you have ideas, improvements, or suggestions â€” feel free to open an issue or pull request. Letâ€™s grow together as data enthusiasts!


ðŸ§  Final Note

This repository is not a finished product â€” itâ€™s a living roadmap that grows every week.
If youâ€™re truly passionate about Data Science, take this as a starting point and research deeper into each concept.

Keep learning, stay curious, and push your limits. ðŸš€
